        "summary": "Audit and fix the backend `placeOrder` function in `backend/main.mo` to ensure every placed order is stored in a single canonical stable map keyed by `orderId`, independent of the caller's principal. Fix `getAllOrders` to return all entries from this single map without any per-caller or per-customer filtering. Fix `getOrdersByCustomer` to query from the same canonical map filtered only by the stored `customerId` field. If orders are currently stored in any per-caller or per-customer scoped structure that is not fully traversed by `getAllOrders`, refactor both functions to use the one unified stable orders map.",

On mount and on navigation to the Menu or Order Confirmation view, the portal must re-fetch the user's latest orders from the backend via `getOrdersByCustomer`. The `useOrdersByCustomer` hook must be enabled whenever the actor and identity are available, and its result must be the authoritative source of order data — not sessionStorage or in-memory state alone.",

Order status displayed on each `OrderCard` must come directly from the fetched backend data, not from local component state.
