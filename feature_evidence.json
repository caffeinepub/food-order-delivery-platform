      "featureTitle": "Add a PIN-based access gate to the Courier App at '/courier'. When a user visits the route, they must first see a PIN entry screen (styled with the app's warm orange/cream theme) instead of the dashboard. If the user enters the PIN '1953' and submits, access is granted and the full Courier App dashboard is shown. If the PIN is incorrect, display a clear error message. The granted access state must be persisted in localStorage so the user does not need to re-enter the PIN on page refresh. A 'Lock' or 'Sign Out' button must be visible in the Courier App UI to clear the access state and return the user to the PIN entry screen. Remove or bypass any existing Internet Identity / role-based access control checks that are currently blocking users in CourierApp.tsx.",
