  "summary": "The diff implements REQ-18 comprehensively. A new PIN gate component (CourierPinGate.tsx) and access hook (useCourierAccess.ts) are added, CourierApp.tsx is updated to use PIN-based access instead of Internet Identity, localStorage persistence is implemented, a Lock button is present in the dashboard header, error feedback with shake animation is included, and the warm orange/cream theme is applied throughout. All acceptance criteria appear to be satisfied.",

    {
      "description": "The CourierPinGate component computes an appId variable from window.location.hostname that is never used in the PIN validation logic or UI — it is dead code not requested by the spec.",
      "reason": "The build request specifies no dynamic app ID derivation or hostname-based logic for the PIN gate; the PIN '1953' is the sole credential and no hostname scoping was requested.",
